# DermDetect - A Skin Cancer Detection Model With IOS Integration
## Exposition
Skin cancer is an extremely harmful disease that presents itelf in early stages, often unrecognized by the untrained eye of the patient. In addition, clinical procedures for official diagnosis of skin cancer often take up to a month. In this time the condition may worsen considerably and leaves the patient in a state of panic and concern. In order to present an alternative perspective on patient skin condition that can be accessed conviently and quickly, we have developed DermDetect. DermDetect is an application that harnesses the intellecual power of Residual Network 50 (ResNet50) in combination with the accessibility of IOS applications to provide free skin classification on four core categories thusfar: Benign Lesions of the Keratosis, Melanoma, and Melanocytic Nevi.

## Technical Details
DermDetect scans an image taken within the app for a classification of the blemish that worries the user.

The installable application DermDetect should be found on the appstore, installed for free. Usage will require a functioning camera. Simply take a close up picture of the blemish in question and allow the program to determine the rest.
